In this project, we aim to develop a Natural Language Processing (NLP)-based Twitter Sentiment Analysis model that effectively classifies tweets into positive or negative sentiments. Sentiment analysis of tweets poses several challenges due to the short, informal, and context-dependent nature of the text. Our objective is to overcome these challenges by implementing a robust machine learning pipeline.

For this purpose, we utilize the TWITTER Dataset, which comprises 1,600,000 tweets collected using the Twitter API. Each tweet in the dataset is labeled based on its sentiment polarity—either positive (1) or negative (0). The dataset consists of six key attributes:


* Target: Defines the sentiment of the tweet.

* IDs: Unique identifiers for each tweet.

* Date: Timestamp when the tweet was posted.

* Flag: Represents the query (set as "NO QUERY" if none exists).

* User: Username of the individual who posted the tweet.

* Text: The actual content of the tweet.

## Project Pipeline Overview

To build an effective sentiment analysis model, we follow a structured machine learning pipeline consisting of the following steps:

* Importing Necessary Dependencies – Loading required libraries for data processing, visualization, and model training.
  
*  Reading and Loading the Dataset – Extracting relevant data from the Sentiment140 dataset.
  
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Understanding dataset properties, missing values, and sentiment distribution.
  
* Data Visualization of Target Variables – Generating insights from text data using visual techniques like Word Clouds.

* Data Preprocessing – Cleaning and transforming text by removing unnecessary elements, tokenizing, stemming, and stopword removal.

* Splitting the Dataset – Dividing the data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

* Feature Extraction using TF-IDF Vectorization – Converting raw text into numerical representations for machine learning models.

* Model Building – Implementing a classification algorithm for sentiment prediction.

* Model Evaluation – Assessing performance using accuracy metrics, classification reports, and confusion matrices.

This end-to-end approach enables us to create an effective sentiment classification model that can analyze and predict sentiment polarity in tweets with high accuracy. By leveraging machine learning and NLP techniques, we aim to develop a real-world sentiment analysis tool that can be applied to various domains, including brand monitoring, social media analytics, and customer feedback analysis.
